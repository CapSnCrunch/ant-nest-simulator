# Social Insects
This is the code repository for the social insect group at the Arizona State University QRLSSP Program. Included are several different simulations of ant colonies and their interaction networks. Some tools for analysis are built into each of the programs with detailed information about each below.

## ant_grid
This program is an adaptation of the model in the paper 'Dynamics of social interactions, in the flow of information and disease spreading in social insects colonies: Effects of environmental events and spatial heterogeneity.' In this paper, ants are modeled on a grid following different movement patterns and having assigned tasks. Some ants will tend to move toward their assigned task zone while others move randomly. The simulation is meant to study the presence and specific shapes and locations of these task zones on the spread of an agent (either information or a pathogen) through the colony over time.

**Parameters:** At the top of the program you will see a number of parameters which can be set before running. Each of these are mostly self-explanatory but note that is a density other than 'N' is given, the N variable will not be used when generating the colonies. Also look at the list f = [sf for i in range(30)]. This value is the number of parallel colonies which are run. If your machine has a difficult time running this, try making the value lower. Once these values are set, you can run the program.

**Nest Drawing:** There are three drawing modes which can be swapped between by pressing 'T' for tunnels (default), 'W' for walls, and 'S' for sfzs. Click and drag anywhere in the window to draw a rectangle. Releasing the mouse will draw the object corresponding to the drawing mode and update the colony.grid attribute. Pressing 'Z' will undo these actions but note that there is no redo feature. Your final nest must be fully connected and have at least one sfz. When you are done drawing a nest, press the space bar to run the simulation for the number of time steps specified in the parameters.

**Figures:** When running, the first colony of the parallel colonies will be displayed (this can be changed by changing the view parameter). The simulation can be stopped early by exiting out of the pop-up window and still give the figures up to the last time step. If less than 50 ants were present in the colony, a directed network will appear showing an aggregate of interactions for the first colony over the time window. The colors correspond to the ants associated sfz and gray represents an ant with random walking style. As the program runs, we will also get motif counts of this network every 50 time steps printed to the terminal. Other figures will include: informed ant proportion over time in all colonies, average informed ant proportion across all colonies, average contact rate within task groups (Rw), average contact rate within task groups (Rb), final motif count bar chart, and spatial heterogeneity degree over time.

## ant_nest
Many studies have been done on interaction networks above ground, but there is a distinct lack of simulations for ants within their nest. This program models the nest as a random undirected graph with a given number of nodes and edges and places ants to move along these edges. Each ant has a random unlarmed speed which increases by a random amount when it becomes alarmed by another ant. Interactions between ants are recorded and displayed both on top of the nest and to the side in a static fashion.
